# React Frontend Challenge – Skip Select Page Redesign

## 🔍 About the Project

This project is a submission for the front-end challenge provided by [wewantwaste.co.uk](https://wewantwaste.co.uk/), focused on redesigning the **Skip Select Page**.

The goal was to improve the UI/UX, responsiveness, and code quality while maintaining existing functionality. The skip options are dynamically fetched from the provided API endpoint and rendered based on postcode selection.
